# About us

We're Flathub an organization focusing on delivering Flatpak packages to the masses. We're not working on the Flatpak itself, but on things that are related to tooling for the ecosystem and other improvements for users of the Flatpak ecosystem.

Flathub owns multiple parts of code, that might be relevant for a GSoC project:

- [Flathub Website](https://github.com/flathub/website/)
- [Flathub Documentation](https://github.com/flathub/documentation)
- [Flatpak external data checker](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-external-data-checker)
- [Flatpak builder lint](https://github.com/flathub/flatpak-builder-lint)
- [IDE Flatpak Wrapper](https://github.com/flathub/ide-flatpak-wrapper)
- [Electron Sample App](https://github.com/flathub/electron-sample-app)

We also might consider projects that are not directly related to Flathub, but to the Flatpak ecosystem in general. Have a look at the repositories of the [Flatpak organization](https://github.com/flatpak) for inspiration.

If we're selected as a mentoring organization for 2024, students will need to read the overview of a good project proposal, follow the outline for proposals when applying, and review the list of project ideas detailed below. Students are welcome to propose new ideas, not mentioned on the list and are encouraged to be as creative as they like.

If you want to work on any of these, please reach out. We don't care about your gender, skin color, religion etc. pp.
All are welcome <3

# Prerequisites

Heavily depends on the project, but in general:
Some coding skills, basic familiarity with Git, solid understanding and interest in programming. Ability to quickly understand existing code is beneficial.

# Project proposals

## Overview

Qualifications for a good Summer of Code proposal:

    Discrete, well-defined, modular
    Comprised of a series of measurable sub-goals
    Based on open specs that are available free of charge
    Based on complete specs

An example of a good proposal is the implementation of a new feature or function that is not available yet.

An example of a less desirable proposal is one that's not as measurable, such as refactoring something.

To re-iterate:

    Localized/isolated code projects = good
    Global code refactoring = bad
    A project should have a set of subgoals, so even if the end goal turns out to be too big some of the parts will be of benefit.
    Not too big! This is an important problem when choosing a project, while it is fun to think about solving a grand project, it's not always realistic. It's better to finish a smaller project than to start a grand one.

## Where to submit proposals

In addition to submitting to the [Google Summer of Code website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), you are highly encouraged to submit your idea/proposal to this repo via issues for discussion. History has shown that students who reach out early to refine and focus the scope of their project are more likely to be selected and successful.

## Proposal outline

Please use this template for your proposal:

```
PROJECT TITLE GOES HERE

    Name:
    Nick in Matrix:
    Summary: A somewhat small but explanatory walkthrough of the project. It should not be overly detailed, just enough to understand the problem trying to be fixed and how this project opts to solve it.
    How will I achieve this: Explain how the project will be done, what technologies are needed, and how to implement them.
    What will the project focus on: Explain what the project will focus on and what the important parts of the project are.
    Benefits: Who will benefit from this project and why. Think about what a user or developer may need or do to benefit from it. Why does it benefit many users.
    Timeline: Set some subgoals and try to put dates to these, this is mostly to help you to not over/under estimate, how long it will take you.
    Goals: What is the goal of the project. A project may not always solve the problem entirely as it may take too much time. Think hard about what can be accomplished during a summer with your skills and deduct from that quite a bit. If the project can't be done after this, perhaps it's better to opt for a smaller one or one with subgoals.
    Requirements: What is needed to complete the project, what code language knowledge, what hardware, etc.
```
